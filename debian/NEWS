policykit-1 (121+compat0.1-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  This version of polkit changes the syntax used for local policy rules:
  it is now the same JavaScript-based format used by the upstream polkit
  project and by other Linux distributions.

  System administrators can override the default security policy by
  installing local policy overrides into /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/*.rules,
  which can either make the policy more restrictive or more
  permissive. Some sample policy rules can be found in the
  /usr/share/doc/polkitd/examples directory. Please see polkit(8) for
  more details.

  Some Debian packages include security policy overrides, typically to
  allow members of the sudo group to carry out limited administrative
  actions without re-authenticating. These packages should install their
  rules as /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/*.rules. Typical examples can be
  found in packages like flatpak, network-manager and systemd.

  Older Debian releases used the "local authority" rules format from
  upstream version 0.105 (.pkla files with an .desktop-like syntax,
  installed into subdirectories of /etc/polkit-1/localauthority
  or /var/lib/polkit-1/localauthority). The polkitd-pkla package
  provides compatibility with these files: if it is installed, they
  will be processed at a higher priority than most .rules files. If the
  polkitd-pkla package is removed, .pkla files will no longer be used.
